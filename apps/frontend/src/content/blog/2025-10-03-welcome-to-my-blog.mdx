# Welcome to My Personal Blog!

This is my **first blog post** using MDX, which allows me to combine Markdown with React components. Pretty cool, right?

## What is MDX?

MDX is a format that lets you seamlessly write JSX in your Markdown documents. This means you can:

- Write normal Markdown content
- Import and use React components
- Create interactive content
- Style everything with Material-UI

## Interactive Example

Here's a Material-UI Alert component right in my blog post:

<Alert severity='success' sx={{ my: 2 }}>
  This is a React component rendered inside my MDX blog post!
</Alert>

And here's a button that actually works:

<Box sx={{ my: 2 }}>
  <Button variant='contained' onClick={() => alert('Hello from MDX!')}>
    Click me!
  </Button>
</Box>

## Code Examples

You can still write code blocks normally:

```typescript
const greeting = (name: string) => {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
};

console.log(greeting('World'));
```

## What's Next?

I'm planning to write about:

1. **React Development** - Tips and tricks
2. **TypeScript** - Advanced patterns
3. **Web Performance** - Optimization techniques
4. **Personal Projects** - What I'm building

> This blog is built with Vite, React, TypeScript, Material-UI, and MDX. The perfect stack for a modern developer blog!

Thanks for reading! ðŸš€
